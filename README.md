## 📘 Overview

Welcome to the repository for my **AI-Powered Data Analysis Internship** with **Excelerate**, held from May to June 2025. I served as the **Team Lead** of **Team E**, working with my brilliant teammates **Iqra** and **Faith**, and supported by incredible mentors.

This internship challenged us to build a full data pipeline—handling data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and designing strategic recommendations for learner retention.

## 📅 Weekly Timeline & Contributions

### 🧹 Week 1 – Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned over 8,500 learner records using Python and Pandas.
- Handled missing values, inconsistent dates, text normalization, and duplicates.
- Engineered features: age, engagement duration, time in opportunity, signup patterns, and gender encoding.

### 📊 Week 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized signup and completion trends using heatmaps, line graphs, and box plots.
- Identified behavioral patterns based on age, gender, and opportunity types.
- Uncovered weak-to-moderate correlations between engagement and demographic factors.

### 🤖 Week 3 – Churn Prediction Modeling
- Built models using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.
- Random Forest achieved better recall (30%) for churn detection, crucial for early intervention.
- Identified top churn predictors: low engagement, young age, late signups, and internship type.

### 🎯 Week 4 – Strategy Design & Recommendation System
- Developed a rule-based recommendation engine to reduce churn:
  - Mentorship for low-engagement or younger users
  - Onboarding nudges for last-minute joiners
  - Weekly prompts and region-based customization
- Delivered a strategic presentation showcasing impact-driven interventions.
